# Classify-the-Spam-Email-Using-Naive-Bayes
<br/>Hello guys, in this project, I will show you how to use Naive Bayes to classify spam email. 
<br/>In the jupyter notebook file, I show the specific steps.
   1. Import dataset and use 'pandas' package to show the dataset.
   2. Data preprocess: lower case, remove all punctuations, tokenization. Meanwhile, I create the Bag of Words Model to represent our documents. This process I create the BOW model from scratch.
   3. Create BOW Model using "sklearn" package as compare.
   4. Train Naive Bayes Model using dataset.
   5. Evaluate Naive Bayes Model.
   6. In order to show more details of Naive Bayes Model, I designed an example to calculate this model.
   
## Result
<br/> Naive Bayes Model finally achieved accuracy over 98%! If you have any question, please let me know. I am happy to discuss with you guys.
