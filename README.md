# Classify-the-Spam-Email-Using-Naive-Bayes
<br/>Hello guys, in this project, I will show you how to use Naive Bayes to classify spam email. 
<br/>In the jupyter notebook file, I show the specific steps.
<br/>1. Import dataset and use 'pandas' package to show the dataset.
<br/>2. Data preprocess: lower case, remove all punctuations, tokenization. Meanwhile, I create the Bag of Words Model to represent our documents. This process I create the BOW model from scratch.
<br/>3. Create BOW Model using "sklearn" package as compare.
<br/>4. Train Naive Bayes Model using dataset.
<br/>5. Evaluate Naive Bayes Model.
<br/>6. In order to show more details of Naive Bayes Model, I designed an example to calculate this model.
   
## Result
<br/> Naive Bayes Model finally achieved accuracy over 98%! If you have any question, please let me know. I am happy to discuss with you guys.
